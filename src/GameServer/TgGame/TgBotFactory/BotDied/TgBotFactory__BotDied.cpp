// ACTIVE â€” thin POST-hook only. The intact native (0x10a8cbf0) does all the
// real work (counters, kismet pins, appending timed respawn entries); we call
// it through CallOriginal and then re-arm the SpawnNextBot drain timer.
//
// Why the re-arm is needed: SpawnNextBot self-schedules only while
// m_SpawnQueue.Num() > 0. Once a roster is fully spawned the queue is empty
// and no timer is armed, so nothing is left to drain the replacement entries
// BotDied appends when the bots later die â€” a bRespawn factory whose bots are
// all killed while the player stays in the encounter volume never comes back.
// Every b_respawn=1 factory in map_tg_bot_factory ships f_respawn_delay=0.0,
// and UE3's AActor::SetTimer treats Rate==0 as "clear this timer"
// (UnLevTic.cpp UpdateTimers removes any entry with Rate==0), so a
// fRespawnDelay-driven kick inside the native cancels itself.
//
// Deliberately conservative: only re-arms when the factory is actually a
// respawner AND the native left pending entries behind, so it can never
// invent spawns of its own.

/* â€¼ï¸ RETIRED full reimplementation â€” superseded by the post-hook above.
// The 2026-06-10 scheduler rewrite made our queue model match retail's, so
// the INTACT native (0x10a8cbf0) does the counter/kismet work itself.
//
// Historical: reimplementation of TgBotFactory::BotDied (0x10a8cbf0). The
// binary's copy is INTACT but operates retail's m_SpawnQueue model, where the
// queue is a pending-respawn scheduler it APPENDS timed entries to on every
// death. Our pre-rewrite factory stack kept m_SpawnQueue as a static
// one-entry-per-group list parallel to m_SpawnGroups, so the intact appends
// grew the queue past the groups array and permanently wedged the factory
// (alarm wave 2 never spawned). This version did the same observable work in
// the OLD model:
//   - decrement factory + group counters (clamped: fallback-factory bots die
//     against factories that never spawned them â€” see ActorCache backfill in
//     SpawnBotById)
//   - stamp fLastKillTime, fire TgSeqEvent_BotDied / TgSeqEvent_FactoryEmpty
//     kismet pins
//   - schedule the respawn tick for bRespawn factories; the decremented
//     group counts make GroupNeedsMore() true so SpawnNextBot refills.
