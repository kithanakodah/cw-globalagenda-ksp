// Custom "Super Agent" game mode. Active only under the difficulty
// GA_G::DIFFICULTY_VALUE_ID_CUSTOM_SUPER_AGENT.
//
// Players stay TF1 (attackers) for the WHOLE match — there is no team flip.
// The mission is reshaped purely by moving map geometry between task forces:
//
//   1. Players kill the boss -> proximity point A (the 5-minute hold) unlocks.
//      On boss death we flip BOTH spawn clusters + the DEFENDER-side door
//      markers/blockers, so a dying player now respawns by the boss room and
//      can walk out.
//   2. Players hold A together for 5 minutes. While holding, configurable
//      capture-% HOOKS fire (see SuperAgentMission.cpp) — e.g. at 25% the
//      boss-room "adds" factories switch to bosses and unleash.
//   3. A captured -> the RESIDUAL door markers/blockers flip, opening the path
//      back to the original spawn. Point B unlocks.
//   4. Players walk back and capture B (default attacker-capture) -> win.
//
// The MISSION ITSELF is authored in SuperAgentMission.cpp. This header is the
// surface that file uses. The machinery (spawning, ticking, geometry flips)
// lives in SuperAgent.cpp and you should rarely need to touch it.
//
// See .planning/2026-06-15-super-agent-game-mode-design.md for the mechanics.
