// Generic mid-game alert sender — center-screen toast + sound, via the
// CHAT_MESSAGE (0x0073) marshal piggyback on the chat dispatcher. See
// `reference_chat_message_alert_piggyback.md` for the wire-shape rationale.
//
// Two send modes:
//   - Send(conn, ...)      → one connection
//   - Broadcast(...)       → every connected player
//   - BroadcastToTaskforce → only members of the given taskforce (1=att,2=def)
//
// Priority / Type are the TgObject.AlertPriority / AlertType enums (see
// TgObject.uc):
//   AlertPriority: 0 Minimal | 1 Normal | 2 High | 3 Critical
//   AlertType:     0 Regular | 1 Beneficial | 2 Detrimental | 3 Important
