// OpenWorldTravel -- routes a player to a persistent open-world zone when they
// Use a Map Transition omega volume (asm_data_set_ui_volumes.volume_type_value_id
// = 1255). The DLL sends REQUEST_TRAVEL with the destination map_game_id; this
// resolves it, guarantees exactly one shared instance per map, and hands the
// session to TcpSession for PLAYER_REGISTER + GSC_GO_PLAY.
//
// Eligibility is data-driven: map_game_info.gameplay_type_value_id must be
// 1554 ("PVE- Open Zone"). Queue maps and mission maps are rejected outright,
// so a mis-authored volume can't be used to teleport into a mission.
